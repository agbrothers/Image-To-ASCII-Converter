# Image-To-ASCII-Converter
A set of modules I wrote in python to convert an image from pixels to representation in strings of ASCII characters.  Images are resized and blocks of pixels are parsed and mapped to characters of matching color and shape to create high fidelity representations of any arbitrary image in text.  Made for fun &amp; for artistic expression.
